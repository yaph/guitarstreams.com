        <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter Lawrence Buck is an American musician and songwriter. He was a co-founder and the lead guitarist of the alternative rock band R.E.M. He also plays mandolin on several R.E.M. songs. Throughout his career with R.E.M. (1980–2011), as well as during his subsequent solo career, Buck has also been at various times an official member of numerous 'side project' groups. These groups included Arthur Buck, Hindu Love Gods, The Minus 5, Tuatara, The Baseball Project, Robyn Hitchcock and the Venus 3, Tired Pony, and Filthy Friends, each of which have released at least one full-length album. Additionally, another side project group called Full Time Men released an EP while Buck was a member, as has a current project called The No-Ones. As well, ad hoc 'supergroups' Bingo Hand Job and Nigel & The Crosses have each commercially released one track.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Peter_Buck_of_REM_in_looking_over_shoulder.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
