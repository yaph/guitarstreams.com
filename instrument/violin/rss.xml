        <title><![CDATA[Les Paul]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/les-paul/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Lester William Polsfuss, known as Les Paul, was an American jazz, country, and blues guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor. He was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar, and his prototype, called the Log, served as inspiration for the Gibson Les Paul. Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. He is credited with many recording innovations. His early experiments with overdubbing, delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Les_Paul_live_3.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
