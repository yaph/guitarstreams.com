        <description><![CDATA[<p>Robert C. Hunter was an American lyricist, singer-songwriter, translator, and poet, best known for his work with the Grateful Dead. Born near San Luis Obispo in California, Hunter spent some time in his childhood in foster homes, as a result of his father's abandoning his family, and took refuge in reading and writing. He attended university in Connecticut for a year before returning to Palo Alto, where he became friends with Jerry Garcia. Garcia and Hunter began a collaboration that lasted through the remainder of Garcia's life.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Robert_Hunter_Town_Hall_2013-10-10.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
