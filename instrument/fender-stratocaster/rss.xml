        <description><![CDATA[<p>Charles 'Chuck' Edward Anderson Berry was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist, and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music. Nicknamed the 'Father of Rock and Roll', he refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as 'Maybellene' (1955), 'Roll Over Beethoven' (1956), 'Rock and Roll Music' (1957) and 'Johnny B. Goode' (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Chuck_Berry_%288275961%29.jpeg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
