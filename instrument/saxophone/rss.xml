He joined as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of founder member Syd Barrett. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). By the early 1980s, they had become one of the highest-selling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million in the United States. Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Pink Floyd continued under Gilmour's leadership and released three more studio albums.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/David_Gilmour_in_Munich_July_2006-ed-.JPG" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Scott Buckley, raised as Scott Moorhead, was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as Sin-é, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels and Herb Cohen, the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley, he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%82%D0%B8_Jeff_Buckley._Revisited._%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F%2C_%D0%9E%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%2C_2015.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
