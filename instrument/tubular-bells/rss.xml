        <description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Gordon Oldfield is an English multi-instrumentalist and composer. His work blends progressive rock with world, folk, classical, electronic, ambient, and new-age music. His biggest commercial success is the 1973 album Tubular Bells – which launched Virgin Records and became a hit in America after its opening was used as the theme for the film The Exorcist. He recorded the 1983 hit single 'Moonlight Shadow' and a rendition of the Christmas piece 'In Dulci Jubilo'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Mike_Oldfield_NOTP_2006.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
