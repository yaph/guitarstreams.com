        <description><![CDATA[<p>Sir George Ivan Morrison is a Northern Irish Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer, whose recording career is in its seventh decade. He began performing as a teenager in the late 1950s, playing a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Known as 'Van the Man' to his fans, he rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B and rock band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic 'Gloria'. His solo career began in 1967, under the pop-hit orientated guidance of Bert Berns, with the release of the hit single 'Brown Eyed Girl'. After Berns's death, Warner Bros. Records bought out Morrison's contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks (1968). While initially a poor seller, the album is now regarded as a classic.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Van-Morrison.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
