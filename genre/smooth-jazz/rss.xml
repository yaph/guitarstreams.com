        <title><![CDATA[Wes Montgomery]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/wes-montgomery/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>John Leslie 'Wes' Montgomery was an American jazz guitarist. Montgomery was known for an unusual technique of plucking the strings with the side of his thumb, which granted him a distinctive sound. He often worked with his brothers Buddy and Monk and with organist Melvin Rhyne. Montgomery's recordings up to 1965 were oriented towards hard bop, soul jazz, and post bop, but around 1965 he began recording more pop-oriented instrumental albums that found mainstream success. His later guitar style influenced jazz fusion and smooth jazz.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Wes_Montgomery.png" alt="Preview">]]></description>
