        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/charlie-hunter/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Charlie Hunter is an American guitarist, composer, and bandleader. First coming to prominence in the early 1990s, Hunter plays custom-made seven- and eight-string guitars on which he simultaneously plays bass lines, chords, and melodies. Critic Sean Westergaard described Hunter's technique as 'mind-boggling...he's an agile improviser with an ear for great tone, and always has excellent players alongside him in order to make great music, not to show off.' Hunter's technique is rooted in the styles of jazz guitarists Joe Pass and Tuck Andress, two of his biggest influences, who blended bass notes with melody in a way that created the illusion of two guitars.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Charliehunter.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
