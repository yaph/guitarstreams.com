        <description><![CDATA[<p>Odetta Holmes, known as Odetta, was an American singer, actress, guitarist, lyricist, and a civil and human rights activist, often referred to as 'The Voice of the Civil Rights Movement'. Her musical repertoire consisted largely of American folk music, blues, jazz, and spirituals. An important figure in the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, she influenced many of the key figures of the folk-revival of that time, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Mavis Staples, and Janis Joplin. Time magazine included her recording of 'Take This Hammer' on its list of the 100 Greatest Popular Songs, stating that 'Rosa Parks was her No. 1 fan, and Martin Luther King Jr. called her the queen of American folk music.'</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Odetta.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
