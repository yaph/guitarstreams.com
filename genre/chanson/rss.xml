        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/jacques-brel/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jacques Romain Georges Brel was a Belgian singer, songwriter, actor and director who composed and performed literate, thoughtful, and theatrical songs that generated a large, devoted following—initially in Belgium and France, later throughout the world. He is considered a master of the modern chanson. Although he recorded most of his songs in French and occasionally in Dutch, he became an influence on English-speaking songwriters and performers, such as Scott Walker, David Bowie, Alex Harvey, Marc Almond and Rod McKuen. English translations of his songs were recorded by many performers, including: Bowie; Walker, Ray Charles; Judy Collins; John Denver; The Kingston Trio; Nina Simone; Frank Sinatra and Andy Williams.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Jacques_Brel_1955.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
