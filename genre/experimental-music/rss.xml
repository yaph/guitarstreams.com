He lived in the UK from 1965 and became a UK citizen in 1970.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Fenklup1968ScottWalker.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/frank-zappa/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Frank Vincent Zappa was an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer, and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse rock musicians of his era.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Zappa_16011977_01_300.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
