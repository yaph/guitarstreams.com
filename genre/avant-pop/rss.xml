        <description><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Dale Johnston was an American singer-songwriter and visual artist regarded as a significant figure in outsider, lo-fi, and alternative music scenes. Most of his work consisted of cassettes recorded alone in his home, and his music was frequently cited for its 'pure' and 'childlike' qualities.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Daniel_Johnston_and_British_Sea_Power_%286935765808%29_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Frank Vincent Zappa was an American singer-songwriter, activist and film-maker. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse musicians of his era.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Zappa_16011977_01_300.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
