        <description><![CDATA[<p>Steven Paul Smith, known professionally as Elliott Smith, was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and lived much of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. Smith's primary instrument was the guitar, though he also played piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style, characterized by his 'whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery', and often used multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Elliott_Smith.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
