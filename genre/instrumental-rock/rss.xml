        <description><![CDATA[<p>Zack Kim Yong Woon 	(born May 5, 1983), or simply, Zack Kim is a Korean guitarist who has become known for his mastery of a technique called two-handed tapping, which involves tapping the guitar strings with both the left and right hands simultaneously. Many guitarists apply tapping to one guitar, but Zack frequently performs on two; his left hand playing one guitar while his right hand plays the other, like playing the piano on the guitar but with the added difficulty of fretting the correct notes. His arrangements include a range of styles, from classical to jazz, as well as quirky arrangements of tunes such as the theme song from the Super Mario Bros. video game.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Zackkim.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
