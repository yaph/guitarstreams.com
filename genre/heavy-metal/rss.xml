        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/carl-johan-grimmark/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Carl Johan Grimmark is a Swedish guitarist. He has appeared with several influential Christian metal bands including Narnia, Saviour Machine, and Rob Rock. He recently joined the band Beautiful Sin in 2006. He also has been a special guest guitarist on fellow Narnia bandmate Christian Liljegren's side projects Divinefire and Audiovision. He recently recorded his debut solo album that is set to be titled Grimmark, where he also handles the lead vocals. Grimmark's style of playing, especially on Narnia's earlier work, is often compared to the neo-classical metal stylings of Yngwie Malmsteen, or under a more broad genre, neo-classicism.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Carl_Johann_Grimmark.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Toshimitsu Deyama , known exclusively by his stage name Toshi, is a Japanese singer and songwriter. He is best known as the lead vocalist and a co-founder of the rock band X Japan, who rose to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s and are credited as founders of the Japanese visual kei movement. Toshi began an extensive solo career in 1992 before leaving X Japan at the end of 1997. By his own admission, Toshi was 'brainwashed' by a group called Home of Heart, whose leader would control his musical output for the next 12 years. In 2007, X Japan reunited and began a world tour. Toshi severed ties with Home of Heart in January 2010 and renewed his solo career. His distinctive, impassioned tenor vocals have been compared to those of Steve Perry. In Japan, he also uses the stage name Ryūgentoshi (龍玄とし).</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Deadpool_2_Japan_Premiere_Red_Carpet_Toshl_%2841555176645%29.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
