        <description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Philip Welch, also known by his stage name Head, is an American musician, singer and songwriter. He is one of the guitarists and founding member of the nu metal band Korn and his solo project Love and Death. Along with fellow Korn guitarist James 'Munky' Shaffer, Welch helped develop Korn's distinctive sound, a mix of sirenlike shards of dissonant guitar that mimicked a turntablist's various effects and rumbling down-tuned riffing, that defined the nu metal aesthetic beginning in the mid-'90s.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/2014228185345_2014-08-16_Rock%27n%27Heim_-_Sven_-_1D_X_-_475_-_DV3P9336_mod_crop.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
