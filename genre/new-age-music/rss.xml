        <description><![CDATA[<p>George Winston is an American pianist who was born in Michigan and grew up mainly in Montana, as well as Mississippi and Florida. He is best known for his solo piano recordings; several of his albums from the early 1980s have sold millions of copies each. He plays in three styles: the melodic approach he developed that he calls 'rural folk piano'; stride piano, primarily inspired by Thomas 'Fats' Waller and Teddy Wilson; and his primary interest, New Orleans R&B piano, influenced by James Booker, Professor Longhair, and Henry Butler.</p>]]></description>
