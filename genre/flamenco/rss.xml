        <description><![CDATA[<p>Francisco Gustavo Sánchez Gomes, known as Paco de Lucía, was a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer. A leading proponent of the new flamenco style, he was one of the first flamenco guitarists to branch into classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of Guitar: Music, History, Players, describe de Lucía as a 'titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar', and Dennis Koster, author of Guitar Atlas, Flamenco, has referred to de Lucía as 'one of history's greatest guitarists'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Paco_de_Lucia_1.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
