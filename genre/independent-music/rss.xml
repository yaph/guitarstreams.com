        <description><![CDATA[<p>Phillip Boa is a German independent music songwriter, musician, singer, guitarist, composer and producer. His current name is unknown after two divorces and name changes. Phillip Boa lives in Dortmund, Hamburg and on the island of Malta. As a songwriter Boa has written over 400 songs, and 21 of his studio albums made it to the top 60 of the charts. He has received several 'Album & Single of the Week' awards in British magazines like NME, Sounds or Melody Maker. The musical style followed by Boa and his band Phillip Boa & The Voodooclub was described in a review by NME as 'a cross between B52's and Captain Beefheart'. The style of his lyrics is a mix of irony, love songs, sarcasm and is often of bizarre and deranged content.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Phillip_Boa_2012_Photo_by_Ole_Bredenfoerder.jpeg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
