        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jorge Duilio Lima Menezes, is a Brazilian popular musician, performing under the stage name Jorge Ben Jor since the 1980s, though commonly known by his former stage name Jorge Ben. His characteristic style fuses samba, funk, rock and bossa nova with lyrics that blend humor and satire with often esoteric subject matter. His hits include 'Chove Chuva', 'Mas Que Nada', 'Ive Brussel' and 'Balança Pena', and have been interpreted by artists such as Caetano Veloso, Sérgio Mendes, Miriam Makeba, and Marisa Monte.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Jorge_Ben_Jor_at_Live_Earth.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
