        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/beth-orton/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Elizabeth Caroline Orton is an English singer-songwriter, known for her 'folktronica' sound, which mixes elements of folk and electronica. She was initially recognised for her collaborations with William Orbit, Andrew Weatherall, Red Snapper and the Chemical Brothers in the mid-1990s. Her UK/US first solo album, Trailer Park, received much critical acclaim in 1996. Orton developed a devoted audience with the release of the BRIT Award-winning album Central Reservation (1999) and the 2002 UK top 10 album, Daybreaker. Her 2006 album, Comfort of Strangers, was followed by a break during which Orton gave birth to her daughter and collaborated with the British guitarist Bert Jansch. Orton returned with Sugaring Season in 2012, which moved towards a purer acoustic sound, followed by a return to electronic music with Kidsticks, released in 2016.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Beth_Orton_Cropped.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <title><![CDATA[Ariel Pink]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/ariel-pink/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Ariel Marcus Rosenberg, professionally known as Ariel Pink, is an American musician, singer, and songwriter whose work draws heavily from 1970s–1980s pop radio. His lo-fi aesthetic and home-recorded albums proved influential to many indie musicians starting in the late 2000s. He is frequently cited as 'godfather' of the hypnagogic pop and chillwave movements, and he is credited with galvanizing a larger trend involving the evocation of the media, sounds, and outmoded technologies of prior decades, as well as an equal appreciation for high and low aesthetic values in indie music.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Ariel_Pinks_Haunted_Graffiti_20101022-001.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
