        <title><![CDATA[Ariel Pink]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/ariel-pink/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Ariel Marcus Rosenberg, also known as Ariel Pink, is an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter whose music draws heavily from 1970s–1980s pop radio and cassette culture. His lo-fi aesthetic and home-recorded albums proved influential to many indie artists in the late 2000s, and he is frequently cited as 'godfather' of the hypnagogic pop and chillwave movements. The majority of his recorded output stems from a prolific eight-year period (1996–2003) in which he accumulated over 200 cassette tapes of material.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Ariel_Pinks_Haunted_Graffiti_20101022-001.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
