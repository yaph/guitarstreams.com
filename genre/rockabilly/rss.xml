        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/roy-orbison/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Roy Kelton Orbison was an American singer, songwriter, and musician known for his impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. His music was described by critics as operatic, earning him the nicknames 'the Caruso of Rock' and 'the Big O'. Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers chose to project defiant masculinity. He performed while standing motionless and wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses, which he wore to counter his shyness and stage fright.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Roy_Orbinson_ontving_gouden_plaat_voor_Pretty_Woman_in_Singel_concertzaal%2C_Roy%2C_Bestanddeelnr_917-5752.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Vincent Eugene Craddock, known as Gene Vincent, was an American musician who pioneered the styles of rock and roll and rockabilly. His 1956 top ten hit with his Blue Caps, 'Be-Bop-a-Lula', is considered a significant early example of rockabilly. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker The Screaming End.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Genevincent015e.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
