        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/jeff-buckley/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Scott Buckley, raised as Scott Moorhead, was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as Sin-é, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels and Herb Cohen, the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley, he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%82%D0%B8_Jeff_Buckley._Revisited._%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F%2C_%D0%9E%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%2C_2015.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
