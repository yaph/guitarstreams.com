        <description><![CDATA[<p>Arjen Anthony Lucassen is a Dutch singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist musician and record producer best known for his long-running progressive metal/rock opera project Ayreon. Lucassen started his career in 1980 as the guitarist and backing vocalist of Dutch band Bodine as Iron Anthony, before joining Vengeance in 1984. After eight years he left the band, wanting to go into a more progressive direction, and released two years later an unsuccessful solo album entitled Pools of Sorrow, Waves of Joy under the nickname Anthony.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Arjen_Anthony_Lucassen.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/paco-de-lucía/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Francisco Gustavo Sánchez Gómez, known as Paco de Lucía, was a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer. A leading proponent of the new flamenco style, he was one of the first flamenco guitarists to branch into classical and jazz. Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton, authors of Guitar: Music, History, Players, describe de Lucía as a 'titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar', and Dennis Koster, author of Guitar Atlas, Flamenco, has referred to de Lucía as 'one of history's greatest guitarists'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Paco_de_Lucia_1.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
