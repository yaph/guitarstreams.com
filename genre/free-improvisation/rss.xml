        <description><![CDATA[<p>Derek Bailey was an English avant-garde guitarist and an important figure in the free improvisation movement. Bailey abandoned conventional performance techniques found in jazz, exploring atonality, noise, and whatever unusual sounds he could produce with the guitar. Much of his work was released on his own label Incus Records. In addition to solo work, Bailey collaborated frequently with other musicians and recorded with collectives such as Spontaneous Music Ensemble and Company.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Bailey1.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
