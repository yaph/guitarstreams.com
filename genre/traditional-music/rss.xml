        <description><![CDATA[<p>Leo Kottke is an acoustic guitarist. He is known for a fingerpicking style that draws on blues, jazz, and folk music, and for syncopated, polyphonic melodies. He overcame a series of personal obstacles, including partial loss of hearing and a nearly career-ending bout with tendon damage in his right hand, to emerge as a widely recognized master of his instrument. He resides in the Minneapolis area with his family.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Leo_Kottke_6-16-07_Photo_by_Anthony_Pepitone.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
