        <description><![CDATA[<p>Sister Rosetta Tharpe was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and recording artist. She attained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s with her gospel recordings, characterized by a unique mixture of spiritual lyrics and electric guitar that was extremely important to the origins of rock and roll. She was the first great recording star of gospel music and among the first gospel musicians to appeal to rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll audiences, later being referred to as 'the original soul sister' and 'the Godmother of rock and roll'. She influenced early rock-and-roll musicians, including Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Sister_Rosetta_Tharpe_%281938_publicity_photo_-_headshot%29.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
