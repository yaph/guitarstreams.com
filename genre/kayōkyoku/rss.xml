        <description><![CDATA[<p>Masao Koga  was a Japanese composer and guitarist known for creating melodies, and a pioneer of Japanese popular music. He was regarded as a notable figure for establishing the genre enka, though Koga considered that he was a ryūkōka composer. He wrote numerous songs for Ichiro Fujiyama and Hibari Misora, and his work has been featured in various films, including Come See the Paradise, and Memoirs of a Geisha. He was the first president of the Japan Composer's Association from 1958 to 1978. A museum was built in Shibuya to honor his achievements, and visitors to the Koga Masao Museum of Music  are able to view exhibits, and memorabilia featuring his work.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Masao_Koga.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Yoshio Tabata  was a Japanese ryūkōka and enka singer, songwriter, and electric guitarist. His debut song 'Shima no Funauta'  was released in 1939. Along with enka-shi Haruo Oka's 1939 debut, his debut had a big impact on Japanese popular music because Japanese popular ryūkōka music of that time was mainly sung by classical music singers such as Ichiro Fujiyama and Noriko Awaya. He was born in Matsusaka, Mie prefecture, Japan.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/%E7%94%B0%E7%AB%AF%E7%BE%A9%E5%A4%AB.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
