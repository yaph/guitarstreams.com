        <description><![CDATA[<p>Masao Koga  was a Japanese composer and guitarist known for creating melodies, and a pioneer of Japanese popular music. He was regarded as a notable figure for establishing the genre enka, though Koga considered that he was a ryūkōka composer. He wrote numerous songs for Ichiro Fujiyama and Hibari Misora, and his work has been featured in various films, including Come See the Paradise, and Memoirs of a Geisha. He was the first president of the Japan Composer's Association from 1958 to 1978. A museum was built in Shibuya to honor his achievements, and visitors to the Koga Masao Museum of Music  are able to view exhibits, and memorabilia featuring his work.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Masao_Koga.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
