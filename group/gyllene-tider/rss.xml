        <description><![CDATA[<p>Per Håkan Gessle is a Swedish pop singer, songwriter and musician. He is best known as the male half and primary songwriter and lyricist of the Swedish pop rock duo Roxette, which he formed with Marie Fredriksson in 1986 and which was disbanded after her death in 2019. The duo achieved international success in the late-1980s and early-1990s with their albums Look Sharp! (1988) and Joyride (1991), and topped the charts in the US four times, most notably with 'It Must Have Been Love' which was featured in the film Pretty Woman. Prior to the formation of Roxette, he had a successful career in native Sweden as the frontman for Gyllene Tider. The band released three number-one albums during the early 1980s but disbanded shortly after their fourth album, The Heartland Café (1984).</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Per_Gessle-Roxette_at_Bospop_festival_The_Netherlands_2011.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
