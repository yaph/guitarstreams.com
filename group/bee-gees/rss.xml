Although his brothers Barry and Robin Gibb were the group's main lead singers, most of their albums included at least one or two compositions by Maurice, including 'Lay It on Me', 'Country Woman', and 'On Time'. The Bee Gees were one of the most successful rock-pop groups ever. Gibb's role in the group focused on melody and arrangements, providing backing vocal harmony and playing a variety of instruments.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Maurice_Gibb_2001.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
