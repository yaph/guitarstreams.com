        <description><![CDATA[<p>Frank 'Poncho' Sampedro is an American guitarist and member of the rock band Crazy Horse, known mainly for his longtime collaboration with singer-songwriter Neil Young. Sampedro has played and recorded with Young in many other configurations aside from Crazy Horse and earned co-writing credits on several Young songs.

Neil ricochets,' says Sampedro.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Neil_Young_%26_Crazy_Horse_in_2012.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
