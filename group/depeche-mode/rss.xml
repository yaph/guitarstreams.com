        <description><![CDATA[<p>Martin Lee Gore is an English songwriter, musician, singer, record producer, and DJ. He is one of the founding members of the electronic rock band Depeche Mode and is its primary songwriter. Gore is the band's guitarist and keyboardist, contributes backing vocals, and occasionally provides lead vocals. Gore possesses a tenor singing voice which contrasts with Dave Gahan's dramatic baritone and is also known for his flamboyant and (sometimes) androgynous stage persona. Gore has also released several solo albums and collaborated with former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke as part of VCMG.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Martin_Gore_2009_London_cropped.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
