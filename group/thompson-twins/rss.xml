        <description><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Alexander Bailey is an English singer, songwriter, composer, musician, and record producer. Bailey came to prominence in the early 1980s as the lead vocalist for the new wave band Thompson Twins, which released five singles that entered the top ten charts in the United Kingdom during the 1980s: 'Love On Your Side', 'We Are Detective', 'Hold Me Now', 'Doctor! Doctor!', and 'You Take Me Up'. He was the only classic member of the band to have formal musical training. From 1994, Bailey was also a member of its later incarnation, Babble, releasing two commercially unsuccessful studio albums.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Tom_Bailey_3.JPG" alt="Preview">]]></description>
