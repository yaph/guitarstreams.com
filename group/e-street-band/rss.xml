        <description><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who is both a solo artist and the leader of the E Street Band. He received critical acclaim for his early 1970s albums and attained worldwide fame upon the release of Born to Run in 1975. During a career that has spanned five decades, Springsteen has become known for his poetic and socially conscious lyrics and lengthy, energetic stage performances, earning the nickname 'The Boss'. He has recorded both rock albums and folk-oriented works, and his lyrics often address the experiences and struggles of working-class Americans.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Bruce_Springsteen_Oslo_2019_193031.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
