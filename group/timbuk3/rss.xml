        <description><![CDATA[<p>Patrick Lee 'Pat' MacDonald is an American musician and songwriter. He is the singer, guitarist, and main songwriter for Timbuk3, nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1987. He formed the duo with his wife, Barbara K. MacDonald, in Madison, Wisconsin in 1984 before moving to Austin, Texas, that same year. Their breakup in 1995 spurred a solo career that has steadily produced releases in both Europe and the US. 'MacDonald is long known for his playful, edgy songs,' says Guitar Player magazine.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Patmacdonald2009.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
