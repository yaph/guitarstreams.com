He is best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist, and backing vocalist of the rock band U2. A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with them as well as one solo record. His understated style of guitar playing, a signature of U2's music, is distinguished by chiming timbres, use of rhythmic delay, drone notes, harmonics, and an extensive use of effects units.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/The_edge_u2_at_brasilia_2011.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
