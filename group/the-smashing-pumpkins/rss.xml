        <description><![CDATA[<p>William Patrick Corgan Jr. is an American musician and songwriter, who is the lead singer, primary songwriter, guitarist, and sole permanent member of The Smashing Pumpkins, in addition to being the owner and sole promoter of the National Wrestling Alliance. Formed by Corgan and guitarist James Iha in Chicago, Illinois, in 1988, the Smashing Pumpkins quickly gained steam with the addition of bassist D'arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band's increasing fame in the 1990s until their break-up in 2000. Corgan started a new band called Zwan, and after their quick demise, he released a solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, in 2005 and a collection of poetry, Blinking with Fists, before setting his sights on reforming Smashing Pumpkins.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Billy_Corgan.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
