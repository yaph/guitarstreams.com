        <description><![CDATA[<p>David Jon Gilmour is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter who was a member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He joined the group as guitarist and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of founding member Syd Barrett. Pink Floyd achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the best-selling and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, the band had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the United States. Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Gilmour assumed leadership of Pink Floyd, and released three more studio albums.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/David_Gilmour_in_Munich_July_2006-ed-.JPG" alt="Preview">]]></description>
