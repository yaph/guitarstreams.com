        <description><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Patrick Shields is an American-born Irish musician, singer-songwriter, composer, and producer, best known as the vocalist and guitarist of the band My Bloody Valentine. My Bloody Valentine became extremely influential on the evolution of alternative rock with their two studio albums Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991), pioneering a subgenre known as shoegaze. Shields's texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars' tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the 'glide guitar' technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine's sound, along with his meticulous production techniques.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Kevin_Shields.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
