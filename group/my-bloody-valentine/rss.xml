        <description><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Patrick Shields is an Irish musician, singer-songwriter, composer, and producer, best known as the vocalist and guitarist of the band My Bloody Valentine. My Bloody Valentine would become extremely influential on the evolution of alternative rock with their two studio albums Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991), both of which pioneered a subgenre known as shoegazing. Shields's texturised guitar sound and his experimentation with his guitars' tremolo systems resulted in the creation of the 'glide guitar' technique, which became a recognisable aspect of My Bloody Valentine's sound, along with his meticulous production techniques.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Kevin_Shields.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
