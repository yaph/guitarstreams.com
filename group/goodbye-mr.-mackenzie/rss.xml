        <description><![CDATA[<p>Shirley Ann Manson is a Scottish singer, songwriter, musician, and actress. She is best known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band Garbage. Manson gained media attention for her forthright style, rebellious attitude, and distinctive voice. For the majority of her career, Manson commuted between her home city of Edinburgh and the U.S. to record with Garbage, which originally formed in Madison, Wisconsin; she now lives and works primarily in Los Angeles, while maintaining a second home in Edinburgh.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Manson2012.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
