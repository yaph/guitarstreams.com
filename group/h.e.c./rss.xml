        <description><![CDATA[<p>Heikki Veikko Harma is a Finnish singer-songwriter who has also distinguished himself as a translator of song lyrics, but has written popular lyrics of his own too. To the public he's better known by the name Hector, which he has used since the release of his 1965 debut single 'Palkkasoturi', a Finnish translation of Buffy Sainte-Marie's 'Universal Soldier'. His 1974 album Hectorock I became the fastest selling record in Finnish history, selling 50,000 units within a few months. Hector was at the height of his popularity in the first half of the 1970s, but his steady string of recordings provided occasional hits well into the 1990s. In 2000s he made strong comeback to popularity with his album Ei selityksiä. That album became one of his most successful albums. In 2007 he made a farewell tour on big arenas, but has performed occasionally after that too. In 2011 he made a massive comeback tour and released a new album Hauras (Fragile) in 2014, ten years after his previous album.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Hectorjyvaskyla.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
