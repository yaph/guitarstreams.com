        <description><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Michael Fletcher is an English musician, singer, composer, author and YouTube vlogger. Among his accomplishments, he is one of the lead vocalists and the Rhythm guitarist of English pop rock band McFly, in addition to being the group's founder. He originally auditioned and was accepted into the band Busted before losing out on the place after the record label Island decided the band should be a trio rather than a four-piece. However, he still carried on writing with the band. In his thirteen-year career as a professional songwriter, Fletcher has penned ten UK number one singles and twenty-one top ten singles. He is credited as having written songs for bands including One Direction, Busted, the Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/ThomasMichaelFletcher.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
