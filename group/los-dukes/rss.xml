        <description><![CDATA[<p>José Alberto Iglesias, better known as Tango or its diminutive Tanguito, was an Argentine rock singer-songwriter. Born into a working class family from western Greater Buenos Aires, he began his career in the early 1960s as the lead singer of the nueva ola group Los Dukes, which recorded two singles released on label Music Hall. In the late 1960s, he became a leading figure in the countercultural underground of Buenos Aires, a scene that gave birth to Argentine rock, the earliest incarnation of Spanish-language rock. Tanguito is celebrated for co-writing Los Gatos' hit 'La balsa', that catapulted the burgeoning rock nacional into massive popularity in the summer of 1967-68. This success led to a contract with RCA Victor which soon ended after the little impact of the 1968 single 'El hombre restante'. Tanguito later worked for Mandioca, Argentine rock's first independent record label founded by producers Jorge Álvarez and Pedro Pujó in 1968.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Tanguito.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
