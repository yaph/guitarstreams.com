        <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Maurice Gold was an American multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, and record producer who influenced much of the Los Angeles-dominated pop/soft rock sound in the 1970s. Gold played on scores of records by other artists, most notably Linda Ronstadt's, and had his own success with the U.S. top 40 hits 'Lonely Boy' (1977) and 'Thank You for Being a Friend' (1978), as well as the UK top five hit 'Never Let Her Slip Away' (1978). In the 1980s, he had further international chart success as one half of Wax, a collaboration with 10cc's Graham Gouldman.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Andrew_gold-1478066307.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
