        <description><![CDATA[<p>Aleksandar Živojinović, better known by his stage name Alex Lifeson, is a Canadian musician, songwriter, and record producer, best known as the guitarist and backing vocalist of the progressive rock band Rush. In 1968, Lifeson co-founded the band that would later become Rush, with drummer John Rutsey and bassist and lead vocalist Jeff Jones. Jones was replaced by Geddy Lee a month later, and Rutsey was replaced by Neil Peart in 1974.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Alex_Lifeson3.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
