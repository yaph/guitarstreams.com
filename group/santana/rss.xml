        <description><![CDATA[<p>Carlos Humberto Santana Barragán audio (help·info) is a Mexican-American guitarist who rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s with his band Santana, which pioneered a fusion of rock 'n' roll and Latin American jazz. Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. In 2015, Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 20 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists. He has received 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, and was inducted along with his namesake band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Carlos_Santana_2.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
