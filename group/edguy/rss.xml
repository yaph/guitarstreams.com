        <description><![CDATA[<p>Tobias 'Eggi' Exxel is the current bass player for the power metal band Edguy. Tobias was hired by Edguy in 1998 when vocalist Tobias Sammet, who had played bass since the band's formation in 1992, decided the band should have someone who could focus on playing the instrument full-time.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Tobias_Exxel_2010.03.20.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
