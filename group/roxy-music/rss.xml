        <description><![CDATA[<p>Bryan Ferry CBE is an English singer and songwriter. His voice has been described as an 'elegant, seductive croon'. He also established a distinctive image and sartorial style; according to The Independent, Ferry and his contemporary David Bowie influenced a generation with both their music and their appearances. Peter York described Ferry as 'an art object' who 'should hang in the Tate'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Bryan_ferry_VieillesCharrues2007.JPG" alt="Preview">]]></description>
