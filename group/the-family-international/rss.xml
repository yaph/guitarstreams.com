        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy Cedric Spencer is a British musician, best known as one of the guitarists in the original line-up of Fleetwood Mac. A member since Fleetwood Mac's inception in July 1967, he remained with the band until his abrupt departure in February 1971, when he joined a religious cult called the 'Children of God', now known as 'The Family International', with which he is still affiliated. After a pair of solo albums in the 1970s, he continued to tour as a musician, but did not release another album until 2006. Releasing further solo albums in 2012, 2014 and 2016, Spencer has also recorded as part of the folk trio Steetley.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Jeremy_Spencer_-_2009-06-14.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
