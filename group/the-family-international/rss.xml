        <description><![CDATA[<p>Jeremy Cedric Spencer is a British musician who was a guitarist and founding member of the rock band Fleetwood Mac from its founding in 1967. He departed abruptly in February 1971, when he joined a religious cult, the Children of God, now known as the Family International, with which he is still affiliated. After a pair of solo albums in the 1970s, he continued to tour as a musician, but did not release another album until 2006. He released further solo albums in 2012, 2014 and 2016, and has also recorded as part of the folk trio Steetley. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Fleetwood_mac_jeremy_spencer_8.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
