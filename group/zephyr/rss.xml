        <description><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Richard Bolin was an American guitarist and songwriter who played with Zephyr, James Gang, and Deep Purple, in addition to maintaining a notable career as a solo artist and session musician. Much of his discography was either unreleased at the time of recording, or had gone out of print and was not released again until years after his death by drug overdose at age 25.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Rock_guitarist_Tommy_Bolin.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
