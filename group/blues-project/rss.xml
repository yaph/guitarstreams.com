        <description><![CDATA[<p>Al Kooper is an American songwriter, record producer and musician, known for organizing Blood, Sweat & Tears, although he did not stay with the group long enough to share its popularity. Throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s, he was a prolific studio musician, playing organ on the Bob Dylan song 'Like A Rolling Stone', French horn and piano on the Rolling Stones song 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', and lead guitar on Rita Coolidge's 'The Lady's Not for Sale', among many other appearances. He also produced a number of one-off collaboration albums, such as the Super Session album that brought together guitarists Mike Bloomfield and Stephen Stills. In the 1970s he was a successful manager and producer, notably recording Lynyrd Skynyrd's first three albums. He has also had a successful solo career, written music for film soundtracks, and has lectured in musical composition. He continues to perform live.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Al_Kooper_30.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
