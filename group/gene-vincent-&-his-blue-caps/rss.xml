        <description><![CDATA[<p>Vincent Eugene Craddock, known as Gene Vincent, was an American musician who pioneered the styles of rock and roll and rockabilly. His 1956 top ten hit with his Blue Caps, 'Be-Bop-a-Lula', is considered a significant early example of rockabilly. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker The Screaming End.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Genevincent015e.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
