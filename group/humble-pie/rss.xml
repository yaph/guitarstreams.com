        <description><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Peter Marriott was an English musician, songwriter and frontman of two notable rock and roll bands, spanning over two decades. Marriott is remembered for his powerful tenor singing voice which belied his small stature, and for his aggressive approach as a guitarist in mod rock bands Small Faces and Humble Pie. Marriott was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Small Faces.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Steve_Marriott_-_Humble_Pie_-_1973.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
