        <description><![CDATA[<p>Steven John Wilson is an English musician, singer, songwriter and record producer. Currently a solo artist, he was the founder, guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter of the band Porcupine Tree, as well as being a member of several other bands, including Blackfield, Storm Corrosion and No-Man. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Wilson has made music prolifically and earned critical acclaim. His honours include four nominations for Grammy Awards: twice with Porcupine Tree, once with his collaborative band Storm Corrosion and once as a solo artist. In 2017 The Daily Telegraph described him as 'a resolutely independent artist' and 'probably the most successful British artist you've never heard of'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Steven_Wilson_%28ZMF_2016%29_jm13763_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
