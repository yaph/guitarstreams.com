        <description><![CDATA[<p>Bernard Joseph Butler is an English musician, songwriter and record producer. He is best known as the first guitarist and lyricist with Suede, until his departure in 1994. He has been hailed by some critics as the greatest guitarist of his generation; BBC journalist Mark Savage called him 'one of Britain's most original and influential guitarists'. He was voted the 24th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a national 2010 BBC poll and is often seen performing with a 1961 cherry red Gibson ES-355 TD SV with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/The_Tears-2005-Roskilde-1.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
