        <description><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Ivan Hicks was an American singer-songwriter known for an idiosyncratic style that combined elements of cowboy folk, jazz, country, swing, bluegrass, pop, and gypsy music. He led ″Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks″. He is perhaps best known for the songs 'I Scare Myself' and 'Canned Music.' His songs are frequently infused with humor, as evidenced by the title of his tune, 'How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away?' His album, Live at Davies (2013), capped over forty years of music.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/DanHicks2009.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
