        <description><![CDATA[<p>Deborah Anne Dyer, known by the stage name Skin, is a British singer, songwriter, electronic music DJ, and occasional model. As Deborah Dyer, Skin studied Interior Design at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, from which she later received an honorary degree. She is best known as the lead vocalist of British rock band Skunk Anansie, a band often grouped as part of the Britrock movement in the UK and gained attention for her powerful, wide-ranging voice and trademark bald look. Mavis Bayton, author of Frock Rock, says that 'women like Skin, Natacha Atlas, Yolanda Charles, Mary Genis, and Debbie Smith are now acting as crucial role models for future generations of black women'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Skin_of_Skunk_Anansie_in_Glastonbury.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
