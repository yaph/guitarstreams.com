        <description><![CDATA[<p>William Stuart Adamson was a Scottish rock guitarist, and lead singer/frontman of the band Big Country. The group's commercial heyday was in the 1980s and '90s. He also performed with the punk rock band Skids in the 1970s and '80s, and the 1990s alternative country band 'The Raphaels'. In the late 1970s the British music journalist John Peel referred to his musical virtuosity as a guitarist as 'a new Jimi Hendrix'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Stuart_Adamson_91.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
