        <description><![CDATA[<p>Timo Tapio Tolkki is a Finnish musician best known as the former guitarist, songwriter and producer of the power metal band Stratovarius. With his tenure lasting for more than twenty years, he was the longest standing member of the band before his departure in 2008. After leaving Stratovarius he formed two supergroups named Revolution Renaissance and Symfonia, both of which have since disbanded. In a 2011 article by Guitar World magazine, Tolkki was included in the all-time top 50 list of the world's fastest guitarists.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Timo_Tolkki_2007.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
