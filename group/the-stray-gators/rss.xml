        <description><![CDATA[<p>Bennett Keith Schaeufele, better known by his stage name Ben Keith, was an American musician and record producer. Known primarily for his work as a pedal steel guitarist with Neil Young, Keith was a fixture of the Nashville country music community in the 1950s and 1960s before working with numerous successful rock, country and pop artists as both a producer and versatile, multi-instrumentalist sideman for over four decades. Neil Young affectionately referred to him as 'Long Grain'. Keith was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2014.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Ben_Keith.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
