        <description><![CDATA[<p>Adam Noah Levine is an American musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor and lead vocalist of the pop rock band Maroon 5. Levine began his musical career in 1994 with the band Kara's Flowers, of which he was the lead vocalist and guitarist. After the commercial failure of their only album, The Fourth World, the group was reformed in 2001 as Maroon 5 – with James Valentine replacing Levine as guitarist. In 2002, they released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US; since then, they have released six more albums: It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014), Red Pill Blues (2017), and Jordi (2021). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, three American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and a World Music Award.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/AdamLevine2011.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
