        <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrew John Partridge is an English singer, songwriter, and record producer who founded the rock band XTC. He and Colin Moulding each acted as a songwriter and frontman for XTC, with Partridge writing and singing about two-thirds of the group's material. While the band were a formative punk group, Partridge's music drew heavily from British Invasion songwriters, and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. The band's only British top 10 hit, 'Senses Working Overtime' (1982), was written by Partridge.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Andy_Partridge.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
