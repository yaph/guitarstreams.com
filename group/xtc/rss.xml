        <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrew John Partridge is an English singer, songwriter, and record producer who founded the rock band XTC. He and Colin Moulding each acted as a songwriter and frontman for XTC, with Partridge writing and singing about two-thirds of the group's material. While the band were a formative punk group, Partridge's music drew heavily from 1960s songwriters, and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. The band's only British top-10 hit, 'Senses Working Overtime' (1982), was written by Partridge.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Andy_Partridge.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
