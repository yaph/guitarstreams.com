The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s during Seattle's grunge movement, and is known for its distinctive vocal style and the harmonized vocals between Cantrell and Layne Staley. Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on Alice in Chains' 1992 EP Sap. After Staley's death in 2002, Cantrell took the role of Alice in Chains' lead singer on most of the songs from the band's post-Staley albums, Black Gives Way to Blue (2009), The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here (2013) and Rainier Fog (2018), with DuVall harmonizing with him in the new songs and singing Staley's vocals in the old songs in live concerts.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Jerry_Cantrell_at_Roskilde_Festival_%28Roskilde%2C_Denmark%29_--_2_July_2010.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
