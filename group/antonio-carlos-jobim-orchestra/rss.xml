        <description><![CDATA[<p>Antônio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim, also known as Tom Jobim, was a Brazilian composer, pianist, songwriter, arranger and singer. Considered one of the great exponents of Brazilian music, Jobim internationalized bossa nova and, with the help of important American artists, merged it with jazz in the 1960s to create a new sound with popular success. As such he is sometimes known as the 'father of bossa nova'.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Ant%C3%B4nio_Carlos_Jobim_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
