He received a Swedish Grammi for his mix on Opeth's Deliverance album, whilst Killswitch Engage's 2014 album, Disarm The Descent was US Grammy nominated. As a performer, he was first known as the guitar player of thrash metal band Sabbat, and also recently guitarist in the second incarnation of the heavy metal band Hell. In 2018, he joined Judas Priest as a touring guitarist following Glenn Tipton's announcement that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and that he would no longer be able to tour.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Andy_Sneap_2007.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
