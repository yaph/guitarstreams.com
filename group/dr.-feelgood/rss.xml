        <description><![CDATA[<p>Wilko Johnson is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter. He was a member of the pub rock/rhythm and blues band Dr. Feelgood in the 1970s. Johnson is known for his distinctive guitar playing style which he achieved by not using a pick but instead relying on fingerstyle. This enabled him to play rhythm guitar and riffs or solos at the same time creating a highly percussive guitar sound.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Wilko_Johnson_01.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
