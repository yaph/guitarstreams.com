        <description><![CDATA[<p>Frank Hannon, is best known as the guitarist, songwriter and a co-founder of the multi-platinum band Tesla, and is now established as a solo singer/songwriter with his album Gypsy Highway. Drawing on his early childhood influences of American Folk artists such as Bob Dylan, John Denver, and Willie Nelson, Frank Hannon has showcased his lyrical, vocal, and 'acoustic' storytelling song writing abilities on the self-produced album. Apart from recent Tesla concerts, Frank Hannon has been performing solo 'acoustic' shows, one in particular was the KGGO 'Summer Jam' in Des Moines Iowa where he performed throughout the day in between artist such as John Waite, 38 special, and BTO in front of 10,000 fans singing by himself with an acoustic guitar, and recently performing with Aaron Lewis who is also known for such solo acoustic performances. Frank has recently formed the independent label RedHawk Records.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Frankhannon.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>
