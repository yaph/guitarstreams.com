        <title><![CDATA[Scott Gorham]]></title>
        <link><![CDATA[https://guitarstreams.com/musician/scott-gorham/]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>William Scott Gorham is an American guitarist and songwriter who was one of the 'twin lead guitarists' for the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy. Although not a founding member of Thin Lizzy, he served a continuous membership after passing an audition in 1974, joining the band at a time when the band's future was in doubt after the departures of original guitarist Eric Bell and his brief replacement Gary Moore. Gorham remained with Thin Lizzy until the band's breakup in 1984. He and guitarist Brian Robertson, both hired at the same time, marked the beginning of the band's most critically successful period, and together developed Thin Lizzy's twin lead guitar style while contributing dual backing vocals as well. Gorham is the band member with the longest membership after founders Brian Downey (drummer) and frontman and bass guitarist, Phil Lynott.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Black_Star_Riders_%E2%80%93_Wacken_Open_Air_2014_06.jpg" alt="Preview">]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>James Ure is a Scottish musician, singer-songwriter and producer. His stage name, Midge, is a phonetic reversal of Jim, the diminutive form of his actual name. Ure enjoyed particular success in the 1970s and 1980s in bands including Slik, Thin Lizzy, Rich Kids and Visage, and as the frontman of Ultravox. In 1984, he co-wrote and produced the charity single 'Do They Know It's Christmas?', which has sold 3.7 million copies in the UK. The song is the second highest-selling single in UK chart history. Ure co-organised Band Aid, Live Aid and Live 8 with Bob Geldof. He acts as a trustee for the charity and also serves as an ambassador for Save the Children.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/MIDGEURE28102005.JPG" alt="Preview">]]></description>
